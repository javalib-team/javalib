    Each instruction is at the index
    corresponding to its absolute offset. The array is padded with the
    OpInvalid instruction. The absolute and relative offset that appear
    in the instructions are therefore valid positions in the array.

    0). The opcode may be encoded with the non-optimal form to fill the
