(*s Sets of integers implemented as Patricia trees, following Chris
    Okasaki and Andrew Gill's paper {\em Fast Mergeable Integer Maps}
    ({\tt\small http://www.cs.columbia.edu/\~{}cdo/papers.html\#ml98maps}).
    Patricia trees provide faster operations than standard library's
    module [Set], and especially very fast [union], [subset], [inter]
    and [diff] operations. *)

(*s The idea behind Patricia trees is to build a {\em trie} on the
    binary digits of the elements, and to compact the representation
    by branching only one the relevant bits (i.e. the ones for which
    there is at least on element in each subtree). We implement here
    {\em little-endian} Patricia trees: bits are processed from
    least-significant to most-significant. The trie is implemented by
    the following type [t]. [Empty] stands for the empty trie, and
    [Leaf k] for the singleton [k]. (Note that [k] is the actual
    element.) [Branch (m,p,l,r)] represents a branching, where [p] is
    the prefix (from the root of the trie) and [m] is the branching
    bit (a power of 2). [l] and [r] contain the subsets for which the
    branching bit is respectively 0 and 1. Invariant: the trees [l]
    and [r] are not empty. *)

(*s Example: the representation of the set $\{1,4,5\}$ is
    $$\mathtt{Branch~(0,~1,~Leaf~4,~Branch~(1,~4,~Leaf~1,~Leaf~5))}$$
    The first branching bit is the bit 0 (and the corresponding prefix
    is [0b0], not of use here), with $\{4\}$ on the left and $\{1,5\}$ on the
    right. Then the right subtree branches on bit 2 (and so has a branching
    value of $2^2 = 4$), with prefix [0b01 = 1]. *)

(*s Empty set and singletons. *)

let empty = Empty

let is_empty = function Empty -> true | _ -> false

let singleton k = Leaf k

(*s Testing the occurrence of a value is similar to the search in a
    binary search tree, where the branching bit is used to select the
    appropriate subtree. *)

let zero_bit k m = (k land m) == 0

let rec mem k = function
  | Empty -> false
  | Leaf j -> k == j
  | Branch (_, m, l, r) -> mem k (if zero_bit k m then l else r)

(*s The following operation [join] will be used in both insertion and
    union. Given two non-empty trees [t0] and [t1] with longest common
    prefixes [p0] and [p1] respectively, which are supposed to
    disagree, it creates the union of [t0] and [t1]. For this, it
    computes the first bit [m] where [p0] and [p1] disagree and create
    a branching node on that bit. Depending on the value of that bit
    in [p0], [t0] will be the left subtree and [t1] the right one, or
    the converse. Computing the first branching bit of [p0] and [p1]
    uses a nice property of twos-complement representation of integers. *)

let lowest_bit x = x land (-x)

let branching_bit p0 p1 = lowest_bit (p0 lxor p1)

let mask p m = p land (m-1)

let join (p0,t0,p1,t1) =

  if zero_bit p0 m then
    Branch (mask p0 m, m, t0, t1)
  else
    Branch (mask p0 m, m, t1, t0)

(*s Then the insertion of value [k] in set [t] is easily implemented
    using [join].  Insertion in a singleton is just the identity or a
    call to [join], depending on the value of [k].  When inserting in
    a branching tree, we first check if the value to insert [k]
    matches the prefix [p]: if not, [join] will take care of creating
    the above branching; if so, we just insert [k] in the appropriate
    subtree, depending of the branching bit. *)

	  else
	    Branch (p, m, t0, ins t1)
	else
	  join (k, Leaf k, p, t)
  in
  ins t

(*s The code to remove an element is basically similar to the code of
    insertion. But since we have to maintain the invariant that both
    subtrees of a [Branch] node are non-empty, we use here the
    ``smart constructor'' [branch] instead of [Branch]. *)

(*s One nice property of Patricia trees is to support a fast union
    operation (and also fast subset, difference and intersection
    operations). When merging two branching trees we examine the
    following four cases: (1) the trees have exactly the same
    prefix; (2/3) one prefix contains the other one; and (4) the
    prefixes disagree. In cases (1), (2) and (3) the recursion is
    immediate; in case (4) the function [join] creates the appropriate
    branching. *)
