From version 2008-07-21 to 2.0
----------------------------------
New features:
* physical equality test to avoid useless operations
* returns physically the same data structure when possible so
  - it consume less memory and
  - physical equality tests work more often
* add a merge (optional) argument to add to improve "modifications" of maps
  (avoid find/add)
* add choose_and_remove in Ptmap and Ptset
* add merge in Ptmap which merges to maps
* add merge_first in Ptmap which is more efficient but less generic than merge
* add inter in Ptmap which restricts the domain of the first map to the domain
  of the second map
* add cardinal, elements, partition and the exists predicate in Ptmap
